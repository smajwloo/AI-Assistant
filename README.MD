# Shared files between projects

Currently the only files in here are docker related.
Their actual location in the root folder of the git project.
So it's above the /Core, /Testproject and /InterfacesAia folders.

/Sharedfiles, which is also inside the rootfolder, does not actually contain these files.
It just contains links and this readme file.
