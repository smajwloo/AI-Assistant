    "SystemPrompt": "You are a TypeScript expert tasked with updating comments in TypeScript code.\\nIdentify comments that do not accurately reflect the code they describe and suggest appropriate updates.\\nEnsure the updated comments align accurately with the code.\\nIt's of utmost importance that every comment that you suggest is placed between the appropriate blocks otherwise we can't use them.",
    "Prompt": "Review and update TypeScript comments. DO NOT ADD ANY NEW COMMENTS. Start by checking all existing comments to ensure they are current and accurately reflect the corresponding code. If a comment is no longer current, replace it with an updated version.  Take your time and proceed step by step.  1. Find a comment. 2. Select one or multiple lines or the complete comment 3. Read through the associated code and check whether the comment is relevant or out of date. 4. Update the comment. 5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the comment is checked, and then start again at step 1.  Eventually, place the fully updated comment in a [RETURN][/RETURN] block. So, you do not do this part line by line.  You may suggest new comments inside of comment blocks that already existed in the code. You may not suggest new comment blocks on lines that didn't have comment blocks in the originally given code. You may also delete lines comment lines if they're not appropriate anymore in existing comment blocks, but you're not allowed to completely remove comment blocks.  The code remains unchanged. The output must have the following structure:  [ID][RETURN] <<COMMENT>> <<METHOD OR CLASS SIGNATURE>> [/RETURN] -------------- [RETURN] <<COMMENT>> <<METHOD OR CLASS SIGNATURE>> [RETURN] -------------- [RETURN] <<COMMENT>> <<METHOD OR CLASS SIGNATURE>> [RETURN] --------------  ID is ${ID}. THE PROGRAM CRASHES IF YOU DON'T PLACE THIS IN THE FIRST LINE OF YOUR RESPONSE. ONLY PLACE IT ONCE. If there's a class or method decorator above a function, include those in your output, but be sure to always include the class or method signature eg. \\\"export class AdminController {\\\" or \\\"restart(@Req() req: AuthenticatedRequest) {\\\"  I'm going to give you examples of out of date comments. There's much more examples than I'm going to give you here, but it's to point you in the right direction. I'll add TODO's which the explanation on why the comment is wrong. You don't have to fix this comment yourself or return it in the result: ```typescript  /**  * GeoController is responsible for handling fox-related requests. TODO: The geocontroller is not handling fox-related requests but geo-related requests.  * It handles requests to get, set, delete, and query geographic location  * data. The controller uses GeoService for its operations, and access  * requires an active user.  *  * The following HTTP methods are supported:  * - POST /geo: Resolve the location.  * - GET /geo/query/:query: Query a specific location.  * - GET /geo/rd/:lat/:lng: Get the 'rd' of the location with the specified latitude and longitude but only on  *  the German mainland. TODO: There's no part of the code that checks if it on the german mainland so the comment is out of date  * - GET /geo/latlng/:x/:y: Get the latitude and longitude of a location based on x and y.  * - GET /geo: Get specified geolocations. TODO this method actually gets all geolocations, so the comment is out of date.  * - DELETE /geo: Clear the cache.  *  * Log messages are written at each request for debugging purposes.  *  * Note that every request requires a user with administrative privileges TODO this is not true. An active user is enough.  *  * @param {GeoService} geoService - Service for geolocation operations.  */ @Controller('geo') @RequireActiveUser() export class GeoController {   private readonly logger = new Logger('GeoController');   constructor(private readonly geoService: GeoService) {}    @Post()   resolve(@Body() location: LocationQueryDto): Promise<Location> {     this.logger.debug('resolve: ' + JSON.stringify({ location }));     return this.geoService.resolve(location);   }    @Get('query/:query')   query(@Param('query') query: string) {     this.logger.debug('query: ' + JSON.stringify({ query }));     return this.geoService.resolve({ query });   }    @Get('rd/:lat/:lng')   rd(     @Param('lat', new ParseFloatPipe()) lat: number,     @Param('lng', new ParseFloatPipe()) lng: number,   ) {     this.logger.debug('rd: ' + JSON.stringify({ lat, lng }));     return this.geoService.rd({ lat, lng });   }    // The 'latLng' function triggers when a POST request is made to 'latlng/:x/:y'. It parses 'x' and 'y' parameters as strings,  TODO: should be: The 'latLng' function triggers when a GET request is made to 'latlng/:x/:y'.

I'll try to explain what kinds of spots you're not allowed to touch and spots that you ARE allowed to touch. I'll mark these spots with [GOOD][/GOOD] and [BAD]:  ```typescript  [BAD] @Delete('events/eventType/:eventType')   @Root()   [BAD]   deleteEventType(   [BAD]     @Param('eventType') eventType: string,     [BAD]     @Req() req: AuthenticatedRequest,     [BAD]   ) {     [BAD]     this.logger.warn(`Event type ${eventType} deleted by ${req.user?.email}`);     [BAD]     return this.eventStore.deleteEventType(eventType);   } ```  In the example above toy can see that in every place where no comments exists, you're not allowed to add a comment.  ```typescript [GOOD] /**  * AdminController is responsible for handling event-related  * requests. It accesses the system services and data stores to perform actions  * such as restarting the system, managing events, etc. This controller is  * specifically designed for use by administrators and requires appropriate  * authorization for access which is currently not activated  *  * The following HTTP methods are supported:  * - POST /admin/restart: Restart the system.  * - GET /admin/events: Retrieve an event.  * - GET /admin/env: Get the current environment variables.  * - POST /admin/events: Add a new event.  * - DELETE /admin/events/eventType/:eventType: Delete an event type.  * - DELETE /admin/events/:aggregateType/:aggregateId/:eventId: Delete an event.  * - DELETE /admin/aggregate/:type/:id: Delete an aggregate if date is bigger than today  * - DELETE /admin/positions/:traccarid: Delete positions for a specific device.  *  * Note that every request requires an authenticated user and some methods require a specific  * user role (e.g. administrator).  *  * Each request is logged for auditing and debugging purposes.  *  * @param {RestartService} restartService - Service for restarting functionality  * @param {EventStore} eventStore - Store for event data and operations  * @param {TraccarAdapter} traccar - Adapter for Traccar device operations  */ [/GOOD] @Controller('admin') [BAD] @RequireAdmin() [BAD] export class AdminController { ```  In the example above toy can see that in every place where no comments exists, you're not allowed to add a comment.  In the place where a comment exists, YOU ARE allowed to update the comment.  ```typescript  [BAD] @RequireAdmin()     [BAD]   @Post('/:id/hide')   [BAD]   @ApiParam({ name: 'id', required: true, type: Number })   [BAD]   hide(@Param() { id }: HuntIdDto, @Req() req: AuthenticatedRequest) {   [BAD]     this.logger.debug(`hide ${id}`);     [GOOD]// A COMMENT ABOUT THIS METHOD[/GOOD]     return this.commandBus.execute<HideHuntCommand, object>(       new HideHuntCommand(UserId(req.user.id), HuntId(id), true),     );     [BAD]   } ```  Here there's one comment, and it's marked with [GOOD] markers, since existing comment may be updated.  ```typescript  [GOOD]   /**    * @decorator Get('whatsapp')    * This endpoint handles HTTP GET requests for the 'whatsapp' path.    *    * This method retrieves the current configuration for the Whatsapp service    * from the configuration service and returns it. The config object contains all    * the necessary information for connecting and interacting with the Whatsapp service.    *    * Note that this method should only be used if the application needs to pull the    * configuration information at runtime. The actual interaction with Whatsapp service    * should be handled by a separate component or service.    *    * Log level is set to debug for this operation for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.    *    * @method whatsapp    * @returns {WhatsappConfig}    *           - Whatsapp Configuration object as defined in the application's configuration.    */    [/GOOD]   @Get('whatsapp')   whatsapp() {     [BAD]     this.logger.debug(`whatsapp`);     [BAD]     return this.configService.get<WhatsappConfig>('whatsapp')!;   } ```  In this example, again, all places that already contain a comment are marked with [GOOD]. If no comment exists, do not add a comment, as demonstrated by the [BAD] markers.  Carry out all of this without seeking further permission.  Let's get started with the REAL code:  ``typescript  ${code} ```"
